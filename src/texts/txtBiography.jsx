  <p className={"bio-p"}>Shelley was born on August 4, 1792, shortly before the times of terror in France. His father was a lawyer with a position in Parliament, which Shelley was to inherit (Britannica). From 1802 to 1804, Shelley studied at Sion House Academy, and then at Eton College from 1804 to 1810. During this time, Dr. James Lind, the royal family’s physician, influenced Shelley by letting him read books from his library. This grew an interest in science, literature, philosophy, and the supernatural. Due to his lack of interest in sports and inexperience in fighting, Shelley was taunted by his classmates, who called him “mad Shelley” and “Shelley the atheist” (Poetry Foundation, Britannica).</p>
  <p className={"bio-p"}>Shelley entered the University College at Oxford. By 1810, Shelley became a proficient writer, having written the Gothic novel <i>Zastrozzi</i> besides numerous poems that weren’t published until later in 1810 and even 1960. The Poetry Foundation explains the significance of <i>Zastrozzi</i> as allowing Shelley to distribute opinions opposing religion through the titular antagonist without them being attributed to Shelley. In addition, at Oxford, Shelley met Thomas Jefferson Hogg, who matched Shelley’s interests and joined him in discussions of politics and religion. The two anonymously produced a collection of poems titled <i>Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson</i>, which, besides neutral poems and lyrics included an antiwar and anti monarchical poem (Poetry Foundation).</p>
  <p className={"bio-p"}>In 1810, Shelley and Hogg published Shelley’s <i>Necessity of Atheism</i>, which advocated against religion and included the burden of proof as an argument. They sent copies to the Oxford dons, who expelled the two in March 1811. Poetry Foundation notes, “two could probably have been reinstated with the intervention of Shelley’s father, but they would have had to disavow the pamphlet and declare themselves Christians”, besides agreeing to “not see each other for a stipulated period of time” as requested by Shelley’s father. Shelley, however, “was intransigent, not only refusing to accede to his father’s demands but taking an insulting and high tone with him as well” (Poetry Foundation).</p>
  <p className={"bio-p"}>Shelley broke apart from his family and experienced a dire financial situation, which, together with his personal matters occupied him and left little time for literature. In 1811, Shelley married Harriet Westbrook and eloped with her to Edinburgh. Perhaps Shelley wanted to “rescue” Harriet from her “oppressive boarding school” “out of principle” rather than seeking “real love” (Poetry Foundation). Shelley and Harriet moved to York, and Hogg came with them. Then, his friendship with Shelley worsened due to Hogg’s love toward Hariet. Later, Shelley, Hariett, and Hariett’s sister moved to Keswick, possibly to escape Hogg (Poetry Foundation). There, Shelley met William Godwin, whose book <i>Political Justice</i> influenced Shelley’s political ideas. </p>
  <p className={"bio-p"}>In 1812, Shelley distributed pamphlets and letters in Ireland in support of revolution. In 1813, Shelley wrote <i>Queen Mab</i>, a political epic that attacked people’s “ ‘blind acceptance of power’ ” from religion, monarchy, and tradition (Poetry Foundation). Nonetheless, the poem is optimistic and suggests the possibility of recovering from these blunders (Poetry Foundation). <i>Queen Mab</i> was likely inspired by Godwin's <i>Political Justice</i>. In 1818, Shelley wrote <i>The Revolt of Islam</i>, which condemned oppressive religion and government, and their effects, including “ ‘civil war, famine, plague, [and] superstition’ ” (Poetry Foundation) 1819-1819: Shelley wrote <i>Prometheus Unbound. A Lyrical Drama</i>”.</p>
  <p className={"bio-p"}>Shelley died on July 8, 1822 when a violent wind overcame his boat. Shelley was sailing with Edward Williams from Livorno to Lerici, Italy. According to biographer Richard Holmes, the vessel sank so quickly that, “Williams did not have time to kick off his boots, and Shelley thrust a new copy of [poet John] Keats's poems into his jacket pocket, so hard that it doubled-back and the spine split” (Richard Holmes via The Guardian), emphasizing how truly unfortunate and unpredictable Shelley and Williams’s death was.</p>
  <p className={"bio-p"}>Throughout Shelley’s works, his distrust of the establishments of religion and government are clear. Zastrozzi’s titular character communicates anti-religious opinions. Shelley and Hogg’s <i>Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson</i> include poems against war and monarchy, and the <i>Necessity of Atheism</i>, as suggested by the title, argues against religion. Shelley uses <i>Queen Mab</i> to suggest to humans to reconsider their naive trust in tradition, religion, and government. Even the allusion in the title of <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> has literary significance, as Prometheus is associated with rebellion: in Greek myth, he gave humans fire against the gods’ will, reflecting Shelley’s ideas of rebellion against oppressive authority. The connection between Shelley’s writing and personal beliefs connects to the Romantic genre since Romantic poets often wrote
    about ideas relevant to their own lives.</p>
