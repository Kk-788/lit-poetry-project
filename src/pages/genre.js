      Romanticism was an artistic movement that lasted from the late 18th to the early 19th century, contrasting the Enlightenment movement. While the Enlightenment focused on formal reasoning and scientific inquiry as the primary means of understanding the world, Romanticism emphasized the importance of emotion and intuition, focusing on natural human feelings rather than logic. Romantic artists used their works as a medium for communicating their personal ideas and emotions. As its legacy, Romanticism influenced many artistic disciplines, including poetry, and its ideas were absorbed into other movements.
