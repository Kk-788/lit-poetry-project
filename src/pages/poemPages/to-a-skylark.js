        In the ode To A Skylark, Percy B. Shelley implements various literary elements including diction, syntax,
        simile, and metaphor to praise a singing bird and explain the significance of learning
        from it. Joyous diction is seen in words like “bright” (34), “melody” (35), “singing” (10), “hymns” (38),
        “love” (45), and “gladness” (101) since they are associated with joy, while “star” (18), “sprite [fairy]” (61),
        “heaven” (18), “rainbow” (33), and “high” (41) show exalted diction since they relate to things perceived to be
        far above the human world. Together, these types of diction praise the skylark and highlight its elegance.
        Additionally, simile and metaphor are used by comparing the bird to “an unbodied joy”, “a star of Heaven” (18),
        “a Poet … / Singing hymns unbidden” (36, 38), and “a high-born maiden / … Soothing her love-laden / Soul…”
        (41, 43-44). These comparisons further exaggerate the praise the skylark deserves by comparing it to things
        related to joy, love, and inspiration. Finally, surprised by the happiness of the Skylark, the speaker requests,
        “Teach me half the gladness / That thy brain must know” (102). The syntactic structure of this sentence is
        imperative, which suggests that there is something that humans have to learn from the skylark since the narrator commands it to share its knowledge. Ultimately, by
        extensively praising the skylark and exalting it beyond pure joy and the stars, and later requesting to learn
        from it, Shelley illustrates that people should recognize the beauty of surrounding nature and learn from it to
        better their own lives.
