        In the poem Ozymandias, Percy Bysshe Shelley uses irony through visual imagery alongside a contrast in diction
        to communicate that power is only temporary. The narrator retells a foreigner’s description of a king’s statue
        in a faraway land. Shelley uses diction that suggests the king’s might through associations with grandness —
        “vast”, “pedestal”, “King of Kings”, “Mighty”, “colossal” (2, 9–11, 13) — and negative feelings of animosity —
        “frown”, “sneer”, “cold command”, and “despair” (4-5, 11). Such diction allows Shelley to exalt the great King
        Ozymandias, who is illustrated as intimidating due to his emotional disposition and power over his enemies.
        The foreigner continues to describe the statue: “Half sunk a shattered visage lies … Nothing beside remains.
        Round the decay / boundless and bare / the lone and level sands stretch far away” (13-15). Implementing visual
        imagery of the statue’s destruction and abandonment, Shelley depicts what has remained after the King’s rule.
        This description is intensified by the use of diction relating to destruction in words such as “trunkless”,
        “sunk”, “shattered”, “lifeless”, “wrinkled”, “nothing”, “decay”, and “wreck” (2, 4–5, 7, 11-13). The
        foreigner’s account of the statue’s appearance features irony as a monument dedicated to a majestic and
        fearful ruler now lies destroyed in an empty desert. Through this use of contrast and irony, Shelley
        communicates that worldly power is only temporary, reminding rulers about the fleeting nature of their control,
        while comforting their subordinates, who may have concerns over strong authority.
