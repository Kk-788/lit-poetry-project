        In his poem O! there are spirits of the air, Percy Bysshe Shelley implements rhetorical questions and a
        contrast in diction to teach against relying on others’ loyalty as people often change. Shelley writes the poem
        in the second person perspective, addressing it to an unidentified person who had searched for love but
        experienced misfortune. Shelley tells the story of the lover, who initially turns away from people at the
        opportunity of meeting mysterious spirits who reside in the evening air. Describing the spirits, Shelley used
        diction through words including, “breeze”, “gentle”, “fair”, “star-beams”, and “lovely” (2-5) , associated with
        pleasant or beautiful things. This use of diction establishes that initially, the spirits are seemingly
        benevolent and trustworthy. However, after the spirits “[c]ast, like a worthless boon” the recipient’s
        “love away” (12), Shelley asks, “[W]herefore didst thou build thine hope / On the false earth's inconstancy?
        . . . Did thine own mind afford no scope / Of love, or moving thoughts to thee?” (19-22). Now, Shelley uses
        rhetorical interrogative sentences to suggest that the lover was naïve in trusting the spirits to be loyal
        and relying on them, reprimanding the folly. Shelley repeats what has happened, again including diction in
        the words “dead”, “departed”, “misery”, “mad”, “scourge”, “severer pangs”, and “dark” (27-28, 30, 33-35, 36),
        associated with gloom and death. These associations contrast with the previous pleasant diction, illustrating
        the ghosts’ betrayal and its effect on their lover. Through the misfortune of the betrayed lover, Shelley
        deters excessive reliance on others due to the risk of betrayal and disappointment, benefiting readers by
        protecting them from these occurrences.
