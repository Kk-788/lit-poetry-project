        <li>Born August 4, 1792, shortly before the times of terror in France (~1792/1793-1794). His father was a lawyer with a position in Parliament, which Shelley was to inherit.</li>
        <li>1802-1804: Studied at Sion House Academy.</li>
        <li>1804-1810: Studied at Eton College. During this time, Dr. James Lind, the royal family’s physician, influenced Shelley as he read books from Lind's library, sparking an interest in science, literature, philosophy, and the supernatural. Shelley, being more interested in these subjects than sports, was taunted by his classmates and called “mad Shelley” and “Shelley the atheist.”</li>
        <li>1810: Shelley entered University College at Oxford. By then, he was an outstanding writer and reader with numerous interests. Shelley's father, recognizing his literary talent, asked the bookseller Slatter and Munday to print for him. At Oxford, Shelley befriended Thomas Jefferson Hogg, who shared similar interests. Together, they discussed politics and religion, producing a collection of poems titled <i>Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson</i>, which contained antiwar and anti-monarchical themes.</li>
        <li>1810: Shelley and Hogg published <i>The Necessity of Atheism</i>, challenging religion and presenting the burden of proof as an argument. They sent copies to the Oxford dons, which led to their expulsion in March 1811. According to the Poetry Foundation, they could have been reinstated with the intervention of Shelley’s father, provided they disavowed the pamphlet, declared themselves Christians, and agreed not to see each other for a period of time. However, Shelley refused, taking an insulting and high tone with his father.</li>
        <li>Shelley broke away from his family, leading to financial difficulties and personal challenges that temporarily shifted his focus from literature.</li>
        <li>1811: At age 19, Shelley married 16-year-old Harriet Westbrook and eloped to Edinburgh. The Poetry Foundation suggests Shelley may have been motivated by a desire to "rescue" Harriet from her "oppressive boarding school" out of principle rather than true love.</li>
        <li>Shelley and Harriet moved to York, where Hogg followed them. Their friendship soured due to Hogg's romantic interest in Harriet.</li>
        <li>Shelley, Harriet, and her sister moved to Keswick, possibly to distance themselves from Hogg. There, Shelley met William Godwin, whose work <i>Political Justice</i> influenced Shelley’s political beliefs.</li>
        <li>1812: Shelley distributed pamphlets and letters in Ireland in support of the revolution.</li>
        <li>1813: Shelley wrote <i>Queen Mab</i>, a political epic that critiqued humanity’s flaws and its "blind acceptance of 'outward shows' of power" (Poetry Foundation).</li>
        <li>1818: Shelley published <i>The Revolt of Islam</i>, condemning oppressive religion and government and their consequences.</li>
        <li>1819-1819: Shelley wrote <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>, a "Lyrical Drama" reflecting rebellion through the character of Prometheus, who defied the gods by giving fire to humans. This symbolized Shelley’s resistance to oppressive authority, aligning with the themes of the Romantic genre.</li>
        <li>Died on July 8, 1822, when a squall overcame his boat while sailing from Livorno to Lerici, Italy, with Edward Williams.</li>
